🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
Project ID: SCT_DS_2

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
We explore survival patterns, demographic distributions, and class-based trends using plots and summary statistics.

📁 Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle Titanic Competition

Filename: titanic.csv

Description: Contains data on passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including features like age, gender, ticket fare, passenger class, and survival status.

🔍 Key Insights
Gender & Class Matter: Women and 1st-class passengers had the highest survival rates.

Children Had Better Odds: Children, especially in higher classes, had better chances of survival.

Most Passengers Were in 3rd Class: A majority of passengers were lower-class males.

Fare vs Survival: Passengers who paid higher fares generally had higher survival rates.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
pandas – Data handling and manipulation

seaborn – Statistical data visualization
