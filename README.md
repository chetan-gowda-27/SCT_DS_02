# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

**Project ID:** `SCT_DS_2`  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.  
We explore survival patterns, demographic distributions, and class-based trends through plots and summary statistics.
